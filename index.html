                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I was born and raised in Belarus. I've always been interested in action sports, computer technologies, languages and psychology. I studied at Linguistic University in Minsk, Belarus. I speak English and Russian fluently. I am a self-driven, outgoing person and I am always looking for new challenges to overcome and problems to solve. For the last few years, I have worked in sales and as an estimator at a  moving company which greatly improved my communication skills. Recently, I completed a 12-week web development immersive course at General Assembly. While there, I acquired skills in programming languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, as well as built web applications using Rails and Backbone.js frameworks.</p>

                      <p>Skydive Pages is a management tool for people involved in the sport of Skydiving. It logs completed jumps, structures their details such as location, aircraft, gear used, exit altitude, freefall time, as well as associated pictures and videos taken during those jumps. It allows users to share jump info/pictures/videos with other users.
                      Users can comment on shared pictures. Owned and commented jumps are grouped in calender allowing intuitive naviagtion. My favourite feature that is already available is a witness signature, that resembles real logbook situation, when every jumped is proof-signed by fellow skydiver. This is an ongoing project, and it's being updated daily.</p>

It contains around 650 state colleges. User can query colleges by their name or any additional details. The server is built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL DB with TDD pattern. In current stage database contains one Schools table with 'title:string' and 'details:jsonb' rows. Postgres Jsonb datatype allows the server to update DB with new schools with any possible new attributes and their values without migrations.</p>
