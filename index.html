                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Dmitry! I’m a full-stack software engineer with a decade of experience building web applications, smart contract
                systems, and real-time platforms. My expertise lies in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, React.js, and Next.js, and I’ve
                recently expanded into blockchain development with Solidity. I’ve spent most of my professional life in New York City,
                 where I gained invaluable experience working in a fast-paced
                tech environment. Currently, I’m based in the Seattle area, but I still maintain strong ties to NYC and visit the city very often,
                I’m equally open to opportunities in NYC or remote
                roles. I’m passionate about crafting solutions that make an
                impact, from designing user experiences to deploying scalable, reliable systems. Whether working independently or on a
                team, I thrive in environments where creativity meets cutting-edge technology. Let’s build something amazing together!</p>

                    <p>This project features the user interface for https://github.com/dmitryjum/us_state_universities API that contains US community
                    college database with some minimal data scraped from schools' Wiki pages. This project lists schools from the database,
                    lists the most popular available keys that are used in schools' descriptions. It allows users search for schools by any
                    property that may come to their mind. The user can sign up and edit any school or add a new school when logged in.
                    It's built with React.js and Redux and Redux thunks

                    <p>API server that daily reads Wikipedia page:  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_universities_in_the_United_States college", looks up college pages from the list on the page, parses college info into hashes and saves in DB, updates existing and adds new ones. It contains around 650 state colleges. User can query colleges by their name or any additional details. The server is built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL DB with TDD pattern. In current stage database contains one Schools table with 'title:string' and 'details:jsonb' rows. Postgres Jsonb datatype allows the server to update DB with new schools with any possible new attributes and their values without migrations.</p>

                      <p>Skydive Pages is a management tool for people involved in the sport of Skydiving. It logs completed jumps, structures their details such as location, aircraft, gear used, exit altitude, freefall time, as well as associated pictures and videos taken during those jumps. It allows users to share jump info/pictures/videos with other users.
                      Users can comment on shared pictures. Owned and commented jumps are grouped in calender allowing intuitive naviagtion. My favourite feature that is already available is a witness signature, that resembles real logbook situation, when every jumped is proof-signed by fellow skydiver. This is an ongoing project, and it's being updated daily.</p>

I have adapted Masonry.js, Angular Bootstrap UI and Fancybox libraries to work with Angular and to have interesting visual effect to place and rearrange video screenshots in the grid.
                        The web site has admin page that allow site owner to manipulate content of the website which is stored on Firebase back-end service.  Admin authorization and I\O is implemented with AngularFire API from Firebase.</p>
